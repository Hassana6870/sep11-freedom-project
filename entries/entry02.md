#### While exploring [Google App's Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) , I wanted to make a schedule for people to use  for anything, and I found the previous lessons to be useful to create it. I also watched this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcsBFEbMuIA&vl=en) to help learn more depth to the tool. The grocery list we did in class will be useful because it may help people add and delete items to whatever they want. I would say that I'm at #3 of teh EDP, since I'm think about way to program and code my work. I would say that I'm using the skill "How to Learn" because I'm using previous knowledge to help me with what I need to use now.
