#### I looked at [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) , but I chose [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) instead. I would say that I'm at stage 2 of the EDP, which is "Research the Problem". I want to know an effective way to code a schdeule for people to use for anything. Since I have chose Google Apps Script, I chose to create a working schdeule that can be used effectively for people to use. I'm learning how to google because it will be very important for me to learn how to code the necessary blocks for my project.
