# Entry 3
##### 2/17/21

#### So far, I am at the point of learning how to code my tool. I have written and typed out some of my notes for the project. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iDpT3Amzs-zvUgz92zh0Z_bosy1KykruoL_HIJtcliQ/edit) are the notes I took while experimenting with Google Apps Script. I learned how to use the spreadsheet to create functions which will be important because I will need to use this in the future.

#### I used some of the sources from the google apps scripts tutorials itself to help me code what I need to code. I feel that spreadsheets is a must because it will help me code the schedule and diet routine for the person using the function. I built on the skill of endurance because I was able to commplete my research while traveling and on vacation.
