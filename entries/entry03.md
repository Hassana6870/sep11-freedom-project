# Entry 3
##### 2/17/21

#### So far, I am at the point of learning how to code my tool. I have written and typed out some of my notes for the project. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iDpT3Amzs-zvUgz92zh0Z_bosy1KykruoL_HIJtcliQ/edit) are the notes I took while experimenting with Google Apps Script. I learned how to use the spreadsheet to create functions which will be important because I will need to use this in the future.
